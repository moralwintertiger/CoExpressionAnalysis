# CoExpressionAnalysis

A Set of python scripts to automate counting of cells coexpressing different markers. First commit is a basic working pipeline. 
Needs to be updated to operate as web app, to allow for running on multiple input files / file types, and to spit out
statistics from each image (number of cells per channel, coexpressors, imagename, etc.)
